What do we mean by this license?
================================

In simple terms, you may use this software as you wish so long as:
 - if you release a commercial product that uses it you put the above
   acknowledgement and logo on the outer, public-facing packaging and any
   other materials such as brochures, instructions, websites, etc.
 - you make the source code available with any modifications on a code
   hosting site such as GitHub or Bitbucket.

If this software is web-based then the above still applies. The website
should still include the credit, logo and link to the Mime Industries website.

You are not allowed to use the terms "Mirobot, "MeArm" or "Mime Industries"
to endorse or promote your product.

Marceau
=======

Marceau is a library that encapsulates all of the generic functionality of Mirobot and extracts it into a useful library to use to build other products on, including the MeArm WiFi. It has the following functionality:
 * Asynchronous JSON message processing (Mirobot protocol) over both Serial and WiFi
 * WiFi Setup and management (ESP8266)
 * Captive portal setup
 * Web server setup
 * WebSocket server setup

It's easy to add new commands to Marceau for use with your own projects; see the examples.
